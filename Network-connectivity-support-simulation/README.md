#Supporting a Customer with Network Connectivity issues
Type: Simulated IT Support Lab (IBM SkillsBuild)

#Overview
This project documents a simulated IT support lab wher I assisted a customer experiencing network connectivity issues. The lab was completed using IBM SkillsBuild and focused on network troubleshooting and customer support skills

#Scenario
A customer reported that, while they can connect to their home network with their laptop, they are unable to to get some other devices on their home network. As an IT support technician, my role was to identify the cause of the issue and help the customer connect all their devices to their home network

#Steps Taken
Asked the customer about more information about the issue, asked basic troubleshooting questions like the last time they experienced the issue and if they have restarted the router
After gathering more information about the situation like how its a fixed number of device that connects to the network (9 random device connects of the 24 devices). I developed a theory that the router hasn't been configured to manage all the devices trying to connect to it
Remotely gained access to their PC using Google Chrome Remote Desktop after asking for permission from the customer
Gained access to the router settings to confirm my theory (theory confirmed)
Reconfigured the DHCP so that the router can assign more IP address to accomodate all of the customer's devices
I confirmed resolution and ensured that the customers could connect all their devices

#What I learned
How to communicate clearly with a customer during troubleshooting
Basic router and network issue identification
Further understanding of the deduction and induction support approach
Also the importance of verifying resolution after toubleshooting
